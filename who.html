                I've been on hormones for 9 months. I've been out publicly for just about the same. Over the past month
                or so I've felt lost. Not lost in my gender, not lost in the sense of spirituality, but lost as in who I
                am. Most people have a journey of self discovery as a teenager. You grow up and discover the harsh
                truths of reality and feel your first few crushing blows of life, with more or less training wheels on.
                I know that isn't the case for everyone, however, that's the way things are supposed to go, atleast for
                some people. I unfortunately was not one of those people.
                <br><br>
                I grew up in a strong Christian household. I went to church three times a week. I told others that I
                believed in God, but deep down I never felt anything. I never felt a connection to my religion, never
                felt like God was moving me, talking to me, or what ever the fuck religious nuts say they feel. I was
                always taught the same thing, grow up, be a strong husband, find a good wife, settle down, have a
                family, be the leader of the household, get a good job, work hard, make money, go to church. The shitty
                part is I believed it. I fell for my parents religious crap just like many other kids have. I let them
                guide my life, hell my mother even picked my career path for me. It took me years to fully admit I was
                an atheist, and that was just to myself.
                <br><br>
                I had a kid at 19 years old. I was married at 18. I love my wife dearly still, and my kids are my world,
                but I still wonder what would be different if I had a childhood without indoctrination. If I even knew
                that being trans was possible before my late teens would I have come out earlier? I don't even wish I
                was cis anymore, I just wish I could have been a happy trans girl as a teenager instead of a depressed,
                shell of a human in a god damn cult. If my parents had been supportive what the fuck would my life look
                like right now?
                <br><br>
                The more I ponder these questions the less answers I have and the more angry, frustrated, and sad I
                feel. I need to figure out who I am. What parts of me are just left overs from indoctrination, which
                parts are actually just my parents forming who they wanted me to be, and which parts are actually
                just... Me?
                <br><br>
                Life is so different now, I go in public a woman, people perceive me as a woman, I'm expected to be a 26
                year old woman. As almost a cruel twist of fate however, I have skipped the training wheels stage of
                growing up. I have a professional job, I have 3 kids, a wonderful loving wife of 7 years, but all of
                that doesn't answer my question. I'm sifting through feelings and experiences that most women my age
                felt and experienced at 13, 14, 15 years old. How in the fuck am I, a grown ass woman, supposed to keep
                my life together without even being able to answer the simple of question, who am I? How can I process
                my emotions, bodily changes, and my identity with the world's crushing expectations?
                <br><br>
                I'm seeking these answers. I hope one day to have them. Unfortunately, this is not that day. Welcome to
                my blog and welcome to the journey of my personal self discovery.
