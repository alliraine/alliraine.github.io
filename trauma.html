            </h2>
            <div class="text-sm">
                we are still sorting this out. for a very long time, until about the physical age of 25 we thought we
                were a cishet boy. we realized our parents weren't perfect and we had a few bad memories but overall
                thought of our parents as good people. after we came out as trans and queer we started realizing that
                our parents were not as amazing as we had originally thought. after about a year and a half of being in
                conflict and in and out of contact with our parents we started having symptoms of complex post tramatic
                stress disorder (cptsd). we began ifs (internal family systems) therapy to try to start healing from
                trauma. prior to this for months we had been avoiding researching plurality because we felt like we were
                plural. we're not sure what lead us to feel that way or what the feelings were but we felt it and did
                not want to figure it out. at one in the morning during a trip on of our partners asked us "have you
                ever thought you could be plural?" out of the blue with no prompted. we realized despite us ignoring it,
                someone had recognized that we were a system despite us even fully knowning it. we believe that ifs also
                allowed us to open up and listen enough to hear our headmates and to begin the process of recognizing
                and exploring that aspect of ourselves.

                our history of abuse
            </h2>
            <div class="text-sm">
                one of the things that had us a bit confused about being a dissociative system was the seamingly lack of
                major childhood trauma. again we knew it wasn't perfect but it wasn't that bad... or so we thought. we
                started remembering bits of things over the course of a month or so. we also reached out to our aunt who
                was around us as children and is a licensed trauma therapist to see if she could help shed some light on
                things. this is what we have pieced together so far.
                <br><br>
                we have catagorisied the abuse to make it a bit easier to write about it but it's also very connected.
                the main root of everything is our parents never healed from their own trauma and passed that on to us
                from a very very young age so you will see that theme throughout.

            </h2>
            <div class="text-sm">
                as most people in our generation, we were spanked. normally it would be on the butt with a wooden spoon.
                this is obviously not great but also is not too uncommon. where it starts to take a worse turn is when
                our parents would hit the back of our hands with a hard wooden spoon because we would try to stop the
                spoon with our hands out of fear of the pain. our parents also would spank when they were angry. this
                would lead to the occasional broken wooden spoon and unpredictable reactions. this lead us to try to
                manage our family's emotions so us and our siblings could avoid getting hurt. when we were younger our
                dad would also use a leather belt to spank us but it would typically be controlled and only one or twice
                per punishment, except for the story below.
                <br><br>
                we have no recollection of the following story but were told it by our parents as a teenager. at one
                point, we estimate we were under 6 years old, our dad got mad and repeatedly whipped us with a leather
                belt completely out of anger. we're not sure how long this lasted for but it apparetly was enough to
                leave marks on our butt (and maybe back?). my parents were releaved by the fact that we did not remember
                this happening.
                <br><br>
                we have other random memories in the form of more foggy flashbacks to being spanked, like the dread of
                seeing our father's brown belt, a random memory of fear seeing our dad taking off his belt to spank us
                with it, etc etc
                <br><br>
                now lets talk about my mother specifically. my mother has (self diagnosed?) OCD, anxiety, depression, and anorexia. some of this leads to our emotional abuse but her eating disorder lead to borderline neglectful abuse. she swears to this day that after being admitted to an inpatient psychaitric facillity for a period of time in her teenage years that she was no longer anorexic. however this is very clearly not the case. all of us kids were skinny. we might not have been quite medically underweight but we were god damn near it. 
                <br><br>
                as soon as all of us kids grew up and left the house, we gained weight. for me& it was 80-100lbs over the course of two years.

            <div class="text-sm">
                we grew up in a cult like level of dedication to christianity. instead of getting therapy or treatment
                for their mental health issues (minus an anti-depressant on occasion) they threw themselves into
                religion heavily. everything was black and white. good or bad. evil or holy. we were taught we couldn't
                even trust all chrisitians to know what was actually the truth and what was actually right. we had to
                only trust those who were fully vetted by our parents. even then they wouldn't agree fully with them. as
                a result our parents started atleast one church which they left the moment they had a disagreement with
                people on what is a proper interpretation of the bible. at some times we wouldn't even go to church
                because they felt like the church wasn't correct. (holy shit writing this out for the first time I'm
                seeing all the major signs of being in a cult holy fuck).
                <br><br>
                our parents realized multiple times that they had more extreme views and would start allowing things,
                but they could change on a dime. i'm not really sure what caused it but it would cause us to have to
                purge of unholy things in our house. i remember at one point veggietales were not christian enough and
                we got rid of all our veggietales movies. these random pruges based on our parents religious
                convinctions lead to an enviroment of uncertanty, on top of the other things that also lead to the same
                outcome.

                how our system formed as a result of the abuse
            </h2>
            <div class="text-sm">
                our current thoughts is zoey was the first member of our system. since she identies as being very
                young and her age about the age at which we know we were whipped repeatedly by a belt out of anger.
                we have no recollection of this but have been told by our parents that it has happened. though she
                could have been formed at an even younger age. zoey identifies as a cisgirl. with that information
                we could assume that she possible could have been the first dissociative identity that was formed
                even prior to our understanding of gender and that we were born a boy. this would explain her being
                stuck at a young to very young age and not having any sense of being trans girl or being a boy.
                <br><br>
                all throughout childhood we used this "skill", dissassocation, to deal with the volitile nature of
                our parents, to escape our emotions, and to deal with crippling gender dysphoria. we found it
                natural to dissassocate as an adult. as a first responder it was easy and natural feeling to
                dissassocate from our emotions. this allowed us to survive 10 years as an emt/firefighter. we used
                dissassocation to avoid confrontation in our relationships. we severly dissassocated during the
                birth of our children to the point of having some memory loss as a result. this kind of consistant
                dissassocation most likely lead to the formation of may/allison/alli.
