                our story of discovery
            </h2>
            <div class="text-sm">
                we are still sorting this out. for a very long time, until about the physical age of 25 we thought we
                were a cishet boy. we realized our parents weren't perfect and we had a few bad memories but overall
                thought of our parents as good people. after we came out as trans and queer we started realizing that
                our parents were not as amazing as we had originally thought. after about a year and a half of being in
                conflict and in and out of contact with our parents we started having symptoms of complex post tramatic
                stress disorder (cptsd). we began ifs (internal family systems) therapy to try to start healing from
                trauma. prior to this for months we had been avoiding researching plurality because we felt like we were
                plural. we're not sure what lead us to feel that way or what the feelings were but we felt it and did
                not want to figure it out. at one in the morning during a trip on of our partners asked us "have you
                ever thought you could be plural?" out of the blue with no prompted. we realized despite us ignoring it,
                someone had recognized that we were a system despite us even fully knowning it. we believe that ifs also
                allowed us to open up and listen enough to hear our headmates and to begin the process of recognizing
                and exploring that aspect of ourselves.

                our history of abuse
            </h2>
            <div class="text-sm">
                one of the things that had us a bit confused about being a dissociative system was the seamingly lack of
                major childhood trauma. again we knew it wasn't perfect but it wasn't that bad... or so we thought. we
                started remembering bits of things over the course of a month or so. we also reached out to our aunt who
                was around us as children and is a licensed trauma therapist to see if she could help shed some light on
                things. this is what we have pieced together so far

                physical abuse
            </h2>
            <div class="text-sm">
                as most people in our generation, we were spanked. normally it would be on the butt with a wooden spoon.
                this is obviously not great but also is not too uncommon. where it starts to take a worse turn is when
                our parents would hit the back of our hands with a hard wooden spoon because we would try to stop the
                spoon with our hands out of fear of the pain. our parents also would spank when they were angry. this
                would lead to the occasional broken wooden spoon and unpredictable reactions. this lead us to try to
                manage our family's emotions so us and our siblings could avoid getting hurt. when we were younger our
                dad would also use a leather belt to spank us but it would typically be controlled and only one or twice
                per punishment, except for the story below.
                <br><br>
                we have no recollection of the following story but were told it by our parents as a teenager. at one
                point, we estimate we were under 6 years old, our dad got mad and repeatedly whipped us with a leather
                belt completely out of anger. we're not sure how long this lasted for but it apparetly was enough to
                leave marks on our butt (and maybe back?). my parents were releaved by the fact that we did not remember
                this happening.

                how our system formed as a result of the abuse
            </h2>
            <div class="text-sm">
                our current thoughts is zoey was the first member of our system. since she identies as being very
                young and her age about the age at which we know we were whipped repeatedly by a belt out of anger.
                we have no recollection of this but have been told by our parents that it has happened. though she
                could have been formed at an even younger age. zoey identifies as a cisgirl. with that information
                we could assume that she possible could have been the first dissociative identity that was formed
                even prior to our understanding of gender and that we were born a boy. this would explain her being
                stuck at a young to very young age and not having any sense of being trans girl or being a boy.
                <br><br>
                all throughout childhood we used this "skill", dissassocation, to deal with the volitile nature of
                our parents, to escape our emotions, and to deal with crippling gender dysphoria. we found it
                natural to dissassocate as an adult. as a first responder it was easy and natural feeling to
                dissassocate from our emotions. this allowed us to survive 10 years as an emt/firefighter. we used
                dissassocation to avoid confrontation in our relationships. we severly dissassocated during the
                birth of our children to the point of having some memory loss as a result. this kind of consistant
                dissassocation most likely lead to the formation of may/allison/alli.
