                Your Transphobia is Killing People

                Transphobia as defined by Dictionary.com as "an aversion or hostility to, disdain for, or fear of
                transgender people." Actions of transphobia include but are not limited to refusing to call people by
                their name, their preferred pronouns, saying they will ALWAYS be their gender assigned at birth, and so
                much more.
                <br><br>
                You may feel you are just doing your duties as Christian refusing to do these things or maybe you just
                want to own the libs. However, your actions are killing people. Your actions are killing my friends. You
                may not be pulling a trigger or committing a hate crime as defined by law, but your blatant disregard
                for others is causing a large number of suicides within the trans community.
                <br><br>
                According to the <a
                    href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/142/4/e20174218/76767/Transgender-Adolescent-Suicide-Behavior">American
                    Academy of Pediatrics</a> transgender male adolescents reported the highest rate of attempted
                suicide (50.8%), followed by non-binary adolescents (41.8%), and transgender female adolescents (29.9%).
                These are kids who are attempting to take their own lives to escape your transphobia.
                <br><br>
                Suicides in the transgender populous isn't exclusive to just adolescents. According to a 2015 survey,
                51% of transgender adults had attempted suicide within a year. I personally know of several friends who
                are dealing with suicidal ideations, and know of one who has attempted suicide within the past two
                months. Never have I had to be so concerned about my friends killing themselves.
                <br><br>
                So next time before you go to share an ill-informed post about how trans women shouldn't be allowed to
                play sports with other women, or how someone is and always will be a man (even if it's satire), consider
                how your actions may take a life. That may be the last straw to push someone over the edge ending their
                precious life.
