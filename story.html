                I find myself telling my story quite often. It's something I enjoy doing because it allows me to look
                back and be encouraged by how far I've come and how much shit I've been through. This is all about my

                Childhood
            </h2>
            <div class="text-sm">
                I was born on June 25th, 1996 in West Virginia two a fairly young conservative Christian couple. My
                parents met at a very conservative Christian university. How conservative? Apparently, men were not
                allowed within 15 feet of the women's dorm if that gives you any ideas.
                <br><br>
                I don't remember a ton from when we lived in West Virginia. We lived down the road from my grandparents,
                Papa and Nana. We would got to church with them on Sundays, or so I have been told. It's not like I
                really remember it. When I was 4 years old we moved from West Virginia to Virginia for my dad's work. My
                dad didn't make great money and we struggled for a little while. Spaghetti and canned tomato sauce was a
                regular meal for us. I still can't eat spaghetti to this day because of how much I ate as a child.
                <br><br>
                I a few memories from my time in Virginia. I would argue that it's the first few memories of signs I was
                trans. I remember always wanting to be around girls at my church. I think I actually wrote a letter to
                one asking her to marry me which my mother had to intercept before I became engaged at 6 years old.
                Looking back though, I'm not so sure if this was as much a crush, as my first feelings of being
                transgender. It's hard to think about this retrospectively and decipher the feelings I had at the time,
                but those feelings obviously couldn't have been about having a life long partner, but rather wanting to
                be friends with someone. My 6 year old brain only processed it as wanting to marry because boys could be
                friends with boys, and girls with girls. This is of course is just speculation but that was probably
                about the time I realized I was different.
                <br><br>
                At 8 years old my family moved once again for work. We moved to upstate South Carolina. This is where
                the majority of my memories and growing up years occurred. It was around this time I can say with
                certainty that I started experiencing gender dysphoria.
                <br><br>
                For the first 3 years we lived in a yellow two story house at the end of a cul-de-sac within a beautiful
                neighborhood full of large old pine trees. My best friend, David, lived at the end of the street. I
                enjoyed playing with him, but I also knew I wasn't like him. Hell, I knew I wasn't like other boys.
                <br><br>
                In the 2nd grade, I was enrolled in a private christian school. During recess there was a small section
                of woods that the teachers let us play in. All the boys got together, found sticks and fought each other
                with sticks. I hated it. I didn't want ANYTHING to do with those boys. Instead, me and three other girls
                built a small fort with sticks and played house. It was honestly the highlight of my days. Eventually
                the boys got in trouble enough times for fighting and hurting each other that we were no longer allowed
                to play in the woods and instead forced to play.... kick ball. Shortly after that my parents pulled me
                from school and continued to homeschool me.
                <br><br>
                As I write this the flood of memories almost overwhelms me. I should have known I was trans. If my
                parents had even let me know that was an option I would have known I was trans. Fuck.
                <br><br>
                It was around this same time I know I started experiencing genital dysphoria.
                <br><br>
                Content warning: I'm about to get REALLY explicit about things. If you are not comfortable reading it
                please skip to the next paragraph. I remember playing outside pretending to be a girl. I would pretend I
                had to go pee and that I had a vagina and would have to sit down and pee. Once I got just a year or told
                older, when I was constipated I pretended I was giving birth, trying to figure out what that would be
                like. I remember for a bit actually sitting to pee to pretend I was a girl.

                Pre-Teen -> Mid-Teens
            </h2>
            <div class="text-sm">
                When I was around 10 we moved a little further north so we could live a bit more in the country. I was
                once again enrolled in a private christian school as a fourth grader. By this point, I knew I preferred
                to be friends with girls. In fact, that's what I did. I had a friend or two who were boys, but more
                because that's what I was supposed to do. Again, half way through the 4th grade my parents pulled me
                from school and started to homeschool me. Honestly though, I didn't mind. I was good at teaching myself
                and I enjoyed the flexible school schedule.
                <br><br>
                At around 12 we got highly involved with our local church and I started to hit puberty. I loved to sing
                as a young child. I thought I was a fantastic singer in fact and I took pride in it. I remember,
                sometime around this time, I become very upset that I started to not be able to sing well anymore. It's
                hard for me to put the timeline together but if I recall correctly this was right around the point my
                voice started to change. I remember specifically being up late one night crying to my mom that I
                couldn't sing well anymore. This wasn't just a feeling for a short time, this last a while too. Months.
                <br><br>
                This time of my life was particularly hard. I was up almost every night crying. For hours about things.
                Random things. While this is a typically hard time for people, I feel like this was abnormally hard for
                me. I honestly don't even remember what I would cry about but I know it happened. I would cry about
                things I had done, guilt I had. I would cry about things I thought. I would cry about things I felt.
                None of this ever clicked as possibly gender dysphoria until just a few months ago. This was also a time
                of a lot of lasting religious trauma, unrelated to transition that I will not get into in this post.
                <br><br>
                Around 13 or 14 my parents started to teach me what I needed to do to be a man. I would sit with my legs
                crossed in more of a feminine way and I was taken aside one day and told I couldn't sit like that
                because it was too girly. I was messaging a friend who was a girl on Google Messenger and I used the
                acronym BFF. My parents had access to my account and I was taken aside and told not to use BFF because
                it was girly. This very well could have been my parents trying to make sure I wasn't bullied by my peers
                but this also should have been a sign to them that maybe, I just was a girl.
                <br><br>
                From 13-16 my life was about the same as described. I had a few crushes at church, I was involved with
                youth group. I was taught sex was a sin and to wait until marriage. I was taught that being gay was an
                abomination. Not once, was I ever told that trans people existed.

            <div class="text-sm">
                At 16, my parents decided to move once again and once again for a better job. This time, we moved to
                Nashville Tennessee. It was here that I met my wife and not too long after we moved. I met my wife at a
                Doctor Who party at the local library. I also started working around then at Chick-fil-a. I had my
                drivers license and started to have some independence. I knew I was a bit different but I was okay with
                that. When I was working I'd have co-workers think I was gay or ask me if I was. I never cared. I also
                had a high voice and would get ma'amed while working driver through and I always just laughed it off. It
                never truly bothered me. I told one of my good friends at the time, that I would be gay if I didn't like
                vagina's so much. My personality fit a gay person much better than a straight person.
                <br><br>
                At 18 I enrolled in EMT school. I was dating my wife seriously at that point and we were planning on
                getting engaged. This is when my depression started. At first I though it was a new asthma medication I
                got which I discontinued. It helped some but not fully. My then girlfriend now wife and I also started
                having sex. When you were raised in an abstinence only household, you don't really learn about birth
                control. The day I planned to propose (and I did propose that day) we found out we were pregnant. We
                were honestly excited. Unfortunately, my family did not see it that way. I will get into this full story
                another time, but essentially when we told them they left me crying in a Starbucks parking lot. Quickly
                after that, we had a "shotgun" wedding.
                <br><br>
                As soon as we were married we moved to Kentucky for school. My wife has a full ride to a college and
                thank god she insisted that she go no matter what.

                Adulthood
            </h2>
            <div class="text-sm mb-4">
                We were broke. Flat broke. And holy shit was I immature. I worked what I could and got by but life was
                hard. Depression was kicking my ass. In late 2015 we had our child. Around this time I went to a really
                dark place. I honestly didn't know how bad it was until after. I would be home alone with my baby in
                between EMS shifts while my wife was working her ass off to get a degree. Baby's cry. That's just what
                they do, but I couldn't handle it. I would lose it. Not on the baby, I had enough self control, but I
                would cry, scream, slam my head on the door frame until I couldn't take it anymore. I would punch the
                door frame or the wall until my hand hurt. I would wish it to be all over. I would be driving to work at
                5 am and look at every passing light pole thinking that if I just crashed into that pole it would be all
                over. I would never act upon it because I could never leave my wife and child but I just wanted to stop
                struggling to survive.
                <br><br>
                At this point I knew I absolutely had to get help so I got prescribed anti-depressants. They helped. Oh
                my god did they help. I felt like I could finally live. I decided to enroll in school myself because
                working an EMS workers wage was not going to cut it. I worked full time, my wife worked part time, I
                went to school full or part time and my wife went to school full time. We powered through.
                <br><br>
                During this time period, I started questioning things. Mainly religion. We were at a very liberal
                university, living on campus. I knew trans people, I knew plenty of gay people and lesbians. Honestly I
                adored lesbians. I wished I could be lesbian. If only I was a girl and could be lesbian that would be so
                much fun. I actually had a few friends come out as trans. I was definitely transphobic to some extent at
                first as well. My wife worked with me for years to break me out of my conservative Christian upbringing.
                After years of questioning, I finally said I was agnostic then later, atheist.
                <br><br>
                One day my wife asked to go on a car ride because she wanted to talk to me about something. So we got in
                the car and started driving. She told me that she was bi-sexual. I was super happy for her. We a few
                months after that we got to go to pride together and she was able to truly be herself. It was a
                beautiful thing to witness. Mind you, this is still 2 years before my egg cracked.
                <br><br>
                Then COVID happened. Honestly, nothing really momentous relating to my trans journey happened during
                this time. We had our third child, became more liberal, and continued with school.

                Coming Out
            </h2>
            <div class="text-sm flex flex-col">
                It was the day before Thanksgiving and we were driving to my parents to celebrate. My wife and I were
                talking about our oldest child who does a lot of gender non-conforming things. I told my wife, "well I
                did those things to as a kid and I'm cis." She responded, "are you though?" I quickly responded "Yeah...
                well I think so." I started to think a bit. After a bit I said, maybe I'm like if anything I'm
                genderfluid maybe but I don't really know. Once we got to my parents I started to panic research every
                spare moment I could get during the holiday. I looked up what it meant to be genderfluid, non-binary,
                trans, etc.
                <br><br>
                The day after we got home from our trip I told my wife I thought I was genderfluid. I came out to a
                select group of friends and people I interacted with on normal basis that I was non-binary/genderfluid.
                I got some eye liner and start playing with it. My wife let me wear some of her cloths but they didn't
                really look good on me. I didn't feel right. I decided to order a bra to see how that felt. One of the
                reason's I didn't think I was trans was because I didn't think I had any dysphoria. I even talked to one
                of my binary trans friends and didn't think I could relate to them about dysphoria.
                <br><br>
                When my bra arrived I put it on and then a dress my wife had that fit me. It was instant euphoria. I
                couldn't believe it. I even looked halfway decent. It was around that time that I found a link on reddit
                to the website genderdysphoria.fyi. I sat up one night and read it through. The next morning I took a
                shower. I thought about everything I had read, and how I felt. When I got out it just hit me. I said
                out-loud, "Fuck. I'm trans" (trans as in binary trans woman). Later that day I told my wife.
                <br><br>
                In the beginning I told myself if I wanted to get hormones I would if I still wanted them at 3o. Within
                a few days I told myself by my birthday. Within 3 weeks I was taking my first estrogen shot. That was
                how quickly I realized I need to transition.
                <br><br>
                It was Christmas season, and I knew my family wasn't going to take it well. I didn't know how badly it
                would go but I hoped for the best and prepared for the worse. I didn't want to ruin anyone's holidays,
                especially my kids, so I waited to come out. That month was absolute hell. I felt horrible being around
                family, "boy moding" as it's called. I felt so uncomfortable. All I wanted to do was to tell everyone. I
                didn't want to hide. My parents trip for Christmas with us kept getting delayed. It was delayed until
                mid-end of January. Those weeks were hellish.
                <br><br>
                Coming out to my family, didn't go well. The day my parents went home I emailed them a letter I had
                written. I wrote that letter and had multiple people review it, including my aunt (my moms sister) and
                my therapist. I literally could not wait any longer and sent it to them as soon as I knew they were
                home. What i wasn't expecting how long it took them to response. It took them 5 days before they
                responded to me. I was left in purgatory not knowing what they thought of me for FIVE DAYS. When they
                finally sent me a letter back I was crushed. They told me they would never refer to me by my new name or
                pronouns. They told me that I would always be their son. I was deadnamed at every possible place they
                could.
                <br><br>
                Since then, things haven't been great between us. I have seen my mother once and my father twice. When I
                asked them to come to by collage graduation, which I had been working my ass off for for 6 years, they
                at first made excuses why they couldn't come. After a bit, my dad decided he would come but my mom
                stayed home. Later she told me she just wasn't ready to see me at that point (I had been out for 4
                months to them). I haven't been allowed to see my youngest sister, because I'm apparently too upsetting
                to her. Most of my family just doesn't really engage with me any more and I don't with them. It's
                painful. I hate every minute of it.

I enjoy being myself and I'm more comfortable within my own skin than I ever have. I enjoy singing and dancing. I love my job, my wife, and my kids.  I'm starting the process for bottom surgery and hoping to have SRS/GCS done this coming up summer. For everything I've lost I've gained in self-love. It's painful. I've had to take a break and cry several times while writing this post. The pain and trauma from my past still haunts me but I have such a light ahead of me that it keeps me going. I can live my life how I want and that is so empowering. I've come out at a time of political wars that use trans people as pawns in their struggles for power. I've been called absolutely horrendous things by strangers for just existing. Through it all it's been worth it. If I die tonight, I'll die a happy, I'll die a woman. If I live another 50 years, I'll live those years as a happy cottage core lesbian with my wonderful wife giving the middle finger to the world trying to take away my right to exist.
