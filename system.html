            to put it simply. we are a system. we are a single body and a single brain shared by multiple beings. the
            person you know is one of many people who live in this body and who help keep the system of alli running and
            alive. we all have our roles in life and all have different preferences, and viewpoints on the world. if you
            think we sound crazy, believe us, we have felt and thought the same thing. however the evidence is
            undenaible that we all exists as seperate but semi coharnt system.

            <span class="mt-4">if we are in person, check our watch face color or hair band color. this will most likely signal who is fronting based on our colors! We will only select one person to be fronting a the moment but we do have more than one of us front pretty regularly. Common co-fronting groups are Alli/Allison, Allison/May, and Allison/Zoey. You won't be able tell based on colors but you will be able tell based on our mannerisms and personalities.</span>
