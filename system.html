                to put it simply. we are a dissociative system. we are a single body and a single brain shared by
                multiple beings. the person you know is one of many people who live in this body and who help keep the
                system of alli running and alive. we all have our roles in life and all have different preferences, and
                viewpoints on the world. if you think we sound crazy, believe us, we have felt and thought the same
                thing. however the evidence is undeniable that we all exists as separate but semi coherent system.

                this is rather unclear and we are working on trying to understand ourselves and our past trauma. we were
                emotionally abused as a child and on atleast one occasion physically abused beyond spanking under the
                age of 6. we also have a history of being raised in a cult-like level of religion, having parents with
                untreated mental disorders, including an eating disorder, and some transference of sexual trauma from a
                young age (under 4). we believe that we split into a traumagenic system prior to age 6 as a coping
                mechanism.

                        especially when she is stressed and overwhelmed. Zoeys identifies as a child and has the mental
                        maturity of someone somewhere between 4 years old and 7 years old. She does have access to all
                        of our memories and experiences so it's especially difficult to process things. We suspect Zoey
                        could have been one of the first people our system to exist after we split. Zoey identifies as a
                        cisgender girl while Allison/Alli/May identify as trans.
