                <li>12/29/2021 - I officially started HRT at 10mg EV IM weekly, 50mg of Spiro daily, 100mg of progesterone daily.</li>
                <li>12/30/2021 - I noticed my nipples being more sensitive than normal and they felt a bit irritated.</li>
                <li>01/02/2022 - My skin started softening and pores on my face seem to get smaller. Over the next week my skin continued to soften.</li>
                <li>01/10/2022 - Emotions seem to be getting more intense and my brain seems to be feeling like it's thinking differently.</li>
                <li>01/11/2022 - In the shower both my wife and I noticed that my boobs seem to be becoming more "boob like" and showing some slight budding.</li>
                <li>01/12/2022 - I think I'm definitely getting some breast growth because my boobs ache, itch, and kinda sting overall. Just overall uncomfortable.</li>
                <li>01/15/2022 - Wow! People said you would be cold but they are totally right!</li>
                <li>01/23/2022 - No more random erections. Skin on shaft seems to be more sensitive, thinner, and be slightly moist/tacky feeling</li>
                <li>03/24/2022 - Haven't updated in a while. Changes the past two months. Less facial hair growth. Boob pain. Breast buds. Less stomach fat. EMOTIONS.</li>
                <li>03/24/2022 - Labs: Testosterone 12 | Estradiol 690 (this will be redone due to it being done a day after injections)</li>

            disclaimer: this site is for us to talk about our life with the world. it's more a less a raw, unfiltered,
            living memoir of our life, past, present and future. it is most likely riddled with typos, bad sentance
            structure, and incomplete thoughts. this isn't meant to be a perfect book but a glimps into our life and
            what it means to be.... us
